<!--     Every time it loops through, it should print "The value is --- and " and a specific message on a line in the DOM.
    The specific messages should state:
        If it is number below 10.
        If the string's character length is more than 5
        If the number is exactly 15
        If none of the above, say "normal"
    When I click on one of the lines, it should change the color of the line from black to blue
    In the end, I should see eight different lines, each one containing a message. None of the lines should have multiple messages.
